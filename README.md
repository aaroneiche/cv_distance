# CV Distance calculation and finding.

These scripts were made while exploring OpenCV as part of a learning project. 

## Running 
There are 3 ways to run this script:

Video:
`python findCircles.py videoname.mp4 video`
Image:
`python findCircles.py imagename.jpg image`
Webcam
`python findCircles.py blerf live`
(Note the above 'filler' arg - this will be fixed in the future.)

## Environment
In order to run this script, you need the following installed in your python environment:
- Python 3 (This was made with Python 3.8.13)
- OpenCV4 with contribs `opencv-contrib-python`
- imutils `opencv-python`
- attrs `attrs`

I strongly recommend using `pyenv` to manage your python versions, and `virtualenv` to create a dependable environment for running OpenCV projects in.
